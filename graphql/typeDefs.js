//Here we have an input type meaning this is the required accepted input for that mutation function (register) and returns the User type
//We will also list all the Query and Mutation function
//The [] around a type means that it is an array. For example, the [Post] means an array of Post
//Make sure that when we call these function resolvers, we pass the required inputs

//In the comments and likes, we need the postId you wanna like or comment on then return that Post indicated by the Post! at the end
